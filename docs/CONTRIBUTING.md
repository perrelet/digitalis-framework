# Contributing to Digitalis Framework

Welcome, brave soul. You've decided to contribute to the framework. Before you do, there are sacred traditions to uphold, ancient rites to perform, and exactly three emojis to choose.

## The Sacred Art of the Commit Message

Every commit in this repository follows a precise format, passed down through generations of developers who understood that code is temporary, but emoji puns are forever.

### The Format

```
type(scope): Brief description in imperative mood 🎭🎪🎠
```

Or without scope:

```
type: Brief description in imperative mood 🎭🎪🎠
```

### Commit Types

| Type | When to Use | Emoji Vibe |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `feat` | New features, methods, classes | Celebration, creation |
| `fix` | Bug fixes, corrections | Tools, repair |
| `break` | Breaking changes (use sparingly!) | Explosions, transformation |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change | Movement, reorganization |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, CSS | Aesthetics, cleaning |
| `doc` | Documentation only | Writing, books |
| `tidy` | Minor cleanup, removing old code | Brooms, trash |
| `tweak` | Small adjustments | Tiny hands, precision |
| `a11y` | Accessibility improvements | Wheelchairs, inclusion |
| `wip` | Work in progress (avoid on main) | Construction |
| `version` | Version bumps | Numbers, celebration |
| `delete` | Removing features/code | Death, farewell |
| `rename` | Renaming things | Arrows, transformation |
| `load` | Autoloader changes | Trucks, delivery |

### The Three Emoji Rule

**Every commit ends with exactly three emojis.** Not two. Not four. Three.

These emojis must tell a story. They are not decoration—they are *documentation*.

## The Emoji Pun Hall of Fame

Study these. Learn from them. Let them guide your spirit.

### Wordplay Legends

| Commit | Why It's Art |
|--------|--------------|
| `feat: Hidden field 🙈🚜` | "Hidden" + "field" = see-no-evil monkey + tractor |
| `feat: Table element 🪑➖🎾` | A chair, because table... ping pong table... |
| `feat: Menu 🍽️📜🛎️` | Restaurant menu! Plate, scroll, service bell |
| `feat: Date_Range field 📅🔫🏁` | Date + range (gun) + start/finish |

| `feat: Range Field 🤠🔫` | Home on the range |
| `fix: soft-shadow mixin 🍦💧🕶️` | Soft serve + shadow + it's cool |

### Narrative Genius

| Commit | The Story |

## Choosing Your Emojis

### Step 1: Find the Pun

Every change has a hidden pun. Your job is to find it.

- Is it a `Table`? Consider furniture: 🪑🏓
- Is it a `Field`? Consider agriculture: 🚜🌾👨‍🌾
- Is it a `View`? Consider seeing: 👁️🏞️🖼️
- Is it a `Post`? Consider mail: 📬📫✉️
- Is it a `Model`? Consider fashion: 💃👗🎭
- Is it a `Term`? Consider school: 📚🎓
- Is it a `Route`? Consider roads: 🛣️🚦
- Is it a `Hook`? Consider fishing: 🎣🐟
- Is it `abstract`? Consider art: 🎭🖼️👩‍🎨

### Step 2: Tell the Story

Your three emojis should have narrative flow:

```
Beginning → Middle → End
Subject → Action → Result
Object → Transformation → Outcome
```

**Good:** `feat: User authentication 🙍🏻‍♂️🔐✅` (user + lock + success)

**Bad:** `feat: User authentication 🎉🌈🦋` (random party vibes)

### Step 3: Consider the Vibe

| Vibe | Emojis |
|------|--------|
| Creation | ✨ 🐣 🌱 🎨 🏗️ |
| Destruction | 💥 🗑️ ☠️ ⚰️ 🔥 |
| Movement | 🚚 ➡️ 🏃 🚀 |
| Connection | 🔗 🤝 👫 🔌 |
| Data | 📊 🗃️ 💾 📦 |
| Success | ✅ 👍 🎉 💪 |
| Failure/Fix | 🔧 🛠️ 🩹 🔨 |
| Magic | 🧙‍♂️ 🔮 ✨ 🪄 |

## The Imperative Mood

Commit messages must be written as commands, not descriptions.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| `Added new feature` | `Add new feature` |
| `Fixed the bug` | `Fix the bug` |
| `Updating styles` | `Update styles` |
| `Changes to model` | `Change model` |

Think: "This commit will..." then write what comes after.

---

## Scope Guidelines

Scope is optional but helpful for larger changes:

```
feat(view): Add merge_param method 🏞️🔗⚙️
fix(query): Handle empty meta_query 🔍🕳️✅
break(model): Change validate signature ✅❌📊
```

Common scopes:
- `view`, `model`, `query`, `admin`, `field`
- `woo`, `acf`, `route`, `auth`
- Class names: `Post`, `User`, `Table`

---

## Examples from the Wild

```bash
# A feature for getting first and last names
feat: `Is_Woo_Customer::get_first_name` and `Is_Woo_Customer::get_last_name` 🙋🏻‍♂️💬💬

# Fixing order status positioning
fix: `Order_Status` position with `$priority` property 🛒📌🚩

# A meta box feature (box + vision goggles + package)
feat: `Meta_Box` 🥽📦

# Auto-resolving model class names (robot + sparkle + teacher)
feat: Auto resolve model class names by specificity 🤖✨👨‍🏫

# The debugger (bug + hammer + detective)
feat: Digitalis Debugger 👾🔨🕵🏻‍♂️

# When things get deprecated
delete: Retire `Deprecated_Component` and `Base` entirely ☠️⚰️🕊️

# Magic method implementation (phone + wizard + witch)
feat: `__call` magic method fallback 📞🔮🧙🏻‍♀️

# The creational pattern (egg + art + gem)
feat: `Creational` pattern 🐣🎨💠
```

## Commit Message Length

- **First line:** Under 50 characters (excluding emojis)
- **Body:** Optional, for complex changes
- **Emojis:** Always exactly 3

If you need more context, add a body:

```
feat: Overhaul View instantiation 💥🤯👀

Complete rewrite of View class to support full instantiation.
- Static properties now properly inherited
- ArrayAccess implemented for param access
- Lifecycle hooks added (before/after)
```

## The Fractal Nature of Good Code

Like a certain mathematical teapot that contains infinite complexity within a finite form, good code exhibits self-similarity at every scale. A well-structured class mirrors the architecture of the entire system. A clean method reflects the philosophy of the framework.

Your commits, too, are fractals—small units that, when viewed together, tell the complete story of the codebase's evolution. Each emoji triplet is a tiny pot of tea, steaming with meaning, infinitely divisible yet perfectly whole.

Some say if you zoom in far enough on the commit history, you'll see the pattern repeating. Class within class. Trait within trait. Emoji within emoji.

But that's probably just the caffeine talking.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Branch naming:** `feature/descriptive-name` or `fix/issue-description`
2. **Commits:** Squash if messy, keep if they tell a story
3. **Description:** Explain the why, not just the what
4. **Tests:** If it breaks, you bought it

---

## Code Style

- **Self-documenting code** over comments
- **Descriptive names** over explanatory comments
- **PSR-4 autoloading** with Digitalis conventions
- **Fluent interfaces** where sensible
- **Traits** for shared behavior
- **Static properties** for class configuration

See [AUTOLOADER.md](./AUTOLOADER.md) for file naming conventions.

---

## Final Wisdom

Before you commit, ask yourself:

1. Would this commit message make sense in 6 months?
2. Do the emojis tell a story?
3. Is there a pun I'm missing?
4. Have I achieved emoji enlightenment?

If you've answered yes to all four, you're ready.

Welcome to the framework. May your commits be atomic and your emojis be dank.

🎭 Happy Contributing 🎪
